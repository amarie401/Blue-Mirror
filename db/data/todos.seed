Drink some water.
Eat something if you haven't in the last three hours.
Take a shower.
If daytime: put something fun on.
If nighttime: turn all your screens off and rest for 15 minutes
Take a walk somewhere.
Go for a run.
Dance around the room to your favorite song!
Say a genuine, nice thing to someone.
Get something small completed.
Hug a friend!
Load the dishwasher.
Take a selfie, cutie.
